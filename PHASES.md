## Backlog — OpenClaw-parity phases

Each entry lists the gap surfaced by the comparison with `research/`
(OpenClaw reference impl) plus the proposed shape.

### Phase 21 — Link understanding

**Goal:** When a user message contains a URL, automatically fetch,
parse, and inject a summary block into the agent's context for that
turn — so agents stop saying "I can't see what's at that link".

Done criteria:
- `crates/core/src/link_understanding/` module: detect URLs (regex
  + Markdown autolinks), fetch via reqwest with size + content-type
  caps, extract main text via `readability`-style heuristic, render
  a `# LINK CONTEXT` system block.
- Per-agent toggle in `agents.yaml` (`link_understanding.enabled`,
  `max_links_per_turn`, `max_bytes`, `cache_ttl_secs`).
- Cache hits surface in telemetry; misses bypass on timeout.
- Recipe doc + opt-out for privacy-sensitive agents.

Reference: `research/src/link-understanding/`.

### Phase 22 — Slack + Discord channel plugins

**Goal:** Land two more inbound/outbound plugins so teams running
on Slack or Discord can adopt the agent without bridging through
WhatsApp/Telegram.

Done criteria:
- `crates/plugins/slack/` and `crates/plugins/discord/` with the
  same `Plugin` trait shape as whatsapp/telegram.
- Each declares `instance` config (multi-workspace), publishes
  `plugin.inbound.<plugin>.<instance>`, consumes
  `plugin.outbound.<plugin>.<instance>` for send-tools.
- Per-binding override (Phase 16) supports them out of the box.
- Per-agent credentials (Phase 17) extends to Slack OAuth + Discord
  bot token; gauntlet validates.
- Setup wizard entries (`agent setup slack` / `discord`).
- Outbound tools: `slack_send_message`, `slack_send_thread`,
  `discord_send_message`, `discord_send_dm`.

Reference: `research/extensions/slack/` and
`research/extensions/discord/`.

### Phase 23 — Realtime voice

**Goal:** Streaming STT (speech → text) → LLM → streaming TTS
(text → audio) loop, so an agent can hold a phone call or live
voice chat instead of just answering text.

Done criteria:
- New crate `crates/realtime-voice/` with provider-registry pattern
  (Deepgram, ElevenLabs, OpenAI Realtime, native browser MediaRecorder).
- Streaming pipeline: audio frames in → STT chunks → LLM
  `chat_stream` → TTS chunks → audio frames out, all bounded by a
  single CancellationToken.
- VAD (voice-activity detection) for interruption — barge-in
  semantics so the user can cut the agent off mid-reply.
- WebRTC bridge optional (call into Twilio / phone-control).
- Telemetry: end-to-end latency histogram (mic → first speech).

Reference: `research/src/realtime-voice/`,
`research/src/realtime-transcription/`, `research/src/tts/`.

### Phase 24 — Image generation provider abstraction

**Goal:** A single `image_generate` tool the LLM can call, backed
by a pluggable provider registry (OpenAI Images, Fal, Runway,
Comfy, Stable Diffusion via Replicate).

Done criteria:
- New crate `crates/media/` with provider trait
  `ImageGenerator: model + base_url + auth → image bytes`.
- Built-in providers for the common cases (start: OpenAI Images,
  Fal). Operators add custom via the same OpenAI-compatible slot
  pattern.
- Tool registers as `image_generate`; the agent attaches the
  resulting image to its outbound message via `Attachment`.
- Output goes through agent's outbound channel allowlist (no
  bypass).
- YAML config under `media.yaml` mirroring `llm.yaml`.

Reference: `research/extensions/fal/`,
`research/extensions/runway/`, `research/extensions/comfy/`,
`research/src/image-generation/`.

### Phase 25 — Auto-fetch web pages and search

**Goal:** Make `web_search` and `web_fetch` first-class agent tools
backed by a provider registry — so any agent can search the web
without an extension.

Done criteria:
- `web_search` tool: queries via Brave / Tavily / Exa /
  SearXNG / Perplexity. Provider chosen via `web_search.provider`
  in agent config.
- `web_fetch` tool: existing `fetch-url` extension promoted to a
  built-in. Reuses Phase 21 link-understanding parser.
- Rate limit per agent + per provider.
- Search results indexed into vector memory for follow-up queries.

Reference: `research/src/web-search/`, `research/src/web-fetch/`,
`research/extensions/brave/`, `research/extensions/tavily/`.

### Phase 26 — Pairing protocol + companion app stub

**Goal:** Replace ad-hoc `agent setup whatsapp` QR / token flows
with a pairing protocol that any companion app (CLI, mobile, web
UI) can drive. Sets up the foundation for native apps later.

Done criteria:
- `crates/pairing/` with setup-code generation, allow-from-store
  persistence, pairing-challenge handshake (Signal-Protocol-style
  X3DH-lite).
- New CLI: `agent pair start` (daemon emits a one-time code),
  `agent pair accept <code>` (companion claims it).
- One reference companion: a minimal web UI under
  `apps/companion-web/` (TypeScript, talks to admin endpoint via
  the paired token instead of loopback only).
- Documents the threat model (who sees the code, expiry, replay).

Reference: `research/src/pairing/`, `research/apps/`.

## Deliberately NOT roadmapped

These OpenClaw features were considered and deferred — listing them
keeps the door open without committing scope.

- **Canvas-host / per-agent web UI** (`research/src/canvas-host/`):
  large UX surface area; hold until Phase 26 pairing lands so a
  companion app can host it.
- **Proxy-capture** (`research/src/proxy-capture/`): valuable for
  debugging extensions but niche; revisit when we hit a real
  observability gap that can't be solved with logs.
- **Auto-reply orchestrator** (`research/src/auto-reply/`):
  OpenClaw built a 50-file system because TS lacked our debounce
  +  per-binding plumbing. Our equivalents are already in core +
  Phase 16; reach for individual primitives only as concrete needs
  surface.
- **Scattered channel plugins** (Matrix, IRC, iMessage, Line, QQ,
  WeChat, Synology, Tlon, …): handled case-by-case under Phase 22
  follow-ups, not as their own phases.

## Current working mode

- New work is tracked as follow-ups and hardening tasks.
- Active backlog lives in `FOLLOWUPS.md`.
- Architecture remains documented in `design-agent-framework.md`.

## How to add a new phase

When a new major implementation phase is introduced:

1. Add the phase title and objective here.
2. Add explicit done criteria.
3. Add the implementation checklist in English.
4. Link follow-up debt entries in `FOLLOWUPS.md`.
5. Update mdBook docs in the same commit.

## Documentation policy

- Keep Markdown documentation in English.
- Keep historical non-English material only in `archive/spanish/*.txt`.
