# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org)
**once `v1.0.0` is tagged**. Until then breaking changes may land on
`main` between any two commits; see the commit history for detail.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Phase 27.1 — `cargo-dist` baseline. `dist-workspace.toml` declares
  the cross-target matrix (`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` host fallback +
  `x86_64`/`aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` + `x86_64`/`aarch64-apple-darwin`
  + `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`). `make dist-check` runs the local smoke
  gate (`scripts/release-check.sh`) over whatever `dist build`
  produced, validating tarball contents + sha256 + host-native
  `--version`. `nexo version` (or `nexo --version --verbose`) prints
  build provenance — git-sha, target triple, build channel, build
  timestamp — captured at compile time by `build.rs` and consumed
  via `env!("NEXO_BUILD_*")`. Dev-only programs (`browser-test`,
  `integration-browser-check`, `llm_smoke`) moved to `examples/` so
  cargo-dist excludes them from release tarballs. `release-plz`
  remains the source of truth for version bumps + crates.io publish
  + per-crate `CHANGELOG.md`. Operator notes:
  [`packaging/README.md`](packaging/README.md), contributor docs:
  [Releases](docs/src/contributing/release.md).
- `agent admin` subcommand: runs a web admin UI behind a Cloudflare
  quick tunnel. Auto-installs `cloudflared` per OS/arch on first run,
  starts a loopback HTTP server, mints a fresh 24-char random
  password per launch, and prints a new `https://…trycloudflare.com`
  URL every time. HTTP Basic Auth (`admin` / `<password>`) gates
  every request. Serves the React + Vite + Tailwind bundle from
  `admin-ui/` embedded at Rust compile time via `rust-embed`. See
  [CLI reference — admin](https://lordmacu.github.io/nexo-rs/cli/reference.html#admin).
- `admin-ui/` scaffold (React 18, Vite 5, TS 5, Tailwind 3). First
  page is a minimal "hello" layout; the full admin surface (agent
  directory, DLQ, live reload, config editor) lands in follow-ups.
  `scripts/bootstrap.sh` runs `npm install && npm run build`
  automatically when `npm` is on PATH.
- Native / no-Docker install path: `docs/src/getting-started/install-native.md` +
  idempotent `scripts/bootstrap.sh` (Linux, macOS, Termux).
- Termux (Android) support:
  - Dedicated install guide `docs/src/getting-started/install-termux.md`
    with root-vs-non-root breakdown.
  - `bootstrap.sh` detects `$TERMUX_VERSION` / `$PREFIX` and branches:
    `pkg install rust`, `$PREFIX/bin`, defaults NATS to `skip` with
    a hint toward `broker.type: local`.
- `BrowserConfig.args: Vec<String>` forwards extra CLI flags to the
  spawned Chrome/Chromium (enables `--no-sandbox` etc. for Termux).
- Repository chrome: `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`,
  `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/{bug_report,feature_request,config}.{md,yml}`,
  `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
- Documentation site (mdBook) published at
  <https://lordmacu.github.io/nexo-rs/> with every subsystem
  documented, Mermaid diagrams, 9 ADRs under `docs/src/adr/`, and
  5 end-to-end recipes under `docs/src/recipes/`.
- Pre-commit docs-sync gate in `.githooks/pre-commit` rejects
  production-file changes without accompanying `docs/` edits unless
  the commit message includes `[no-docs]`.
- CI: `.github/workflows/docs.yml` builds mdBook + rustdoc and
  deploys to GitHub Pages; broken local-link scan.

### Changed

- Dual-licensed `MIT OR Apache-2.0` with an enforceable `NOTICE`
  attribution block (ADR 0009).
- `README.md` rewritten with badges and deep links into the
  published documentation.
- **C1** — `EffectiveBindingPolicy` now resolves four additional
  per-binding overrides (`lsp`, `team`, `config_tool`, `repl`) using
  the same replace-whole strategy as `proactive` / `remote_triggers`.
  **Behavioural change**: configs that already declared
  `inbound_bindings[].repl: { ... }` will start applying it — the
  override field had been declared in Phase 79.12 but the resolver
  was missing, silently inheriting the agent-level value. Three new
  optional fields (`lsp`, `team`, `config_tool`) added to
  `InboundBinding`; defaults inherit, so pre-existing YAML is
  unaffected. `binding_validate::has_any_override` extended to
  count the seven previously-uncounted overrides
  (`plan_mode` / `role` / `proactive` / `repl` / `lsp` / `team` /
  `config_tool`); this fixes the misleading `binding without
  overrides` warning. The actual consumption of the new resolved
  fields by tool-registration paths in `src/main.rs` remains
  pinned to boot — runtime hot-reload of these policies is
  tracked under C2.

### Deprecated

_Nothing yet._

### Removed

_Nothing yet._

### Fixed

- Setup wizard no longer hardcodes a shared `whatsapp.session_dir`
  — the writer derives a per-agent path when the YAML field is
  empty, avoiding cross-agent session collisions.
- Extension tools are gated on `Requires::missing()`: if declared
  `bins` / `env` aren't available, the extension is skipped with a
  warn log instead of registering tools that fail every call.

### Security

- `SECURITY.md` formalizes the private disclosure channel
  (<informacion@cristiangarcia.co>) and sets expected response SLAs.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-24 (initial public release)

First public cut of the codebase. All 16 internal development
phases complete (120/120 sub-phases in `PHASES.md`). No backward-
compatibility commitments yet — treat the public surface as unstable
until `v1.0.0`.
